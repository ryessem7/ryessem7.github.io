### Business Sales Exploratory Data Analysis 
I conducted a comprehensive Business Sales Analysis to assist a company in identifying the most effective sales method for their new product line. In this project I meticulously examined historical sales data provided by the company's sales team to guide the company to the optimal sales approach in maximzing the success of their new product line.
